```

3. install chinese fonts

```

since the size of font file is kind of hugeï¼Œdidn't find a good way to restore it

you can download it from network or 

copy it in your windows system, default location is C:\Windows/Fonts

after you put font files in a directory successfully

exec `mkfontscale` in fonts directory to generate font index

you can you `fc-list :lang=zh` to check the font installed in your system
